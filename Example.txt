Winter. Winter broke in. Only yesterday, the wind was driving fallen leaves through the streets, and a cold rain was falling. This morning everything is white. During the night, the snow cloud had generously shared the snow, which now sparkled and shimmered in the rays of the bright morning sun. The faces of passers-by, dressed in warm fur coats and down jackets, were childishly happy. The children did not hide their delight and loudly rejoiced at the long-awaited snow. Real snow battles unfolded near schools. Many students, and some teachers were fired at with snowballs. Everyone on this day was happy, elated mood.
